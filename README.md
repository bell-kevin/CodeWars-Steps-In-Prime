"# steps-in-prime-Codewars" 
The prime numbers are not regularly spaced. For example from 2 to 3 the step is 1. From 3 to 5 the step is 2. From 7 to 11 it is 4. Between 2 and 50 we have the following pairs of 2-steps primes:

3, 5 - 5, 7, - 11, 13, - 17, 19, - 29, 31, - 41, 43

We will write a function step with parameters:

g (integer >= 2) which indicates the step we are looking for,

m (integer >= 2) which gives the start of the search (m inclusive),

n (integer >= m) which gives the end of the search (n inclusive)

In the example above step(2, 2, 50) will return [3, 5] which is the first pair between 2 and 50 with a 2-steps.

So this function should return the first pair of the two prime numbers spaced with a step of g between the limits m, n if these g-steps prime numbers exist otherwise nil or null or None or Nothing (depending on the language).

Examples:

step(2, 5, 7) --> [5, 7]

step(2, 5, 5) --> nil

step(4, 130, 200) --> [163, 167]

([193, 197] is also such a 2-steps primes between 130 and 200 but it's not the first pair).

step(6, 100, 110) --> [101, 107] though there is a prime between 101 and 107: 103; the pair 101-103 is a 2-step.

Note:

The idea of "step" is close to that of "gap" but it is not exactly the same. For those interested they can have a look at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeGaps.html. A "gap" is more restrictive: there must be no primes in between (101-107 is a "step" but not a "gap". Next kata will be about "gaps":-).


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
